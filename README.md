# Online-Course-Recommendation
Developed a hybrid course recommendation system using a 100,000-record dataset. The system employed Content-Based Filtering, Collaborative Filtering (TruncatedSVD), and a custom popularity metric. All components, including the scaler and models, were persisted for immediate deployment into a live e-learning platform.
